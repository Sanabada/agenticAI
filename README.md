mplements an agentic workflow over a local Ollama model (SmolLM 1.7B) using LangChain + LangGraph. The system uses structured prompting + JSON parsing, validation, and repair to guarantee 3 tags and a ≤25-word, one-sentence summary, with a supervisor-style graph enabling iterative refinement. Future work: add persistent state, branching graphs, retrieval/tool calling, evaluation harnesses, and deploy as a lightweight service for offline summarization/tagging pipelines.
